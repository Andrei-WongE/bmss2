Phylolinguistics tutorial at BMSS2

This repository includes MCMC output from two studies:
* Bouckaert, Bowern & Atkinson (Nature E&E, 2018) on Pama-Nyungan languages
* Sagart, Jacques, Lai, Ryder, Thouzeau, Greenhill & List (PNAS, 2019) on Sino-Tibetan languages

In both cases, you will find two files with trees: one with all languages, and one with a subset of languages. The latter can be faster to analyse and easier to visualize.
